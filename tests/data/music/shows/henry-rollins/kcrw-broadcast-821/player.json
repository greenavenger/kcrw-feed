{"html_description": "<p>Fanatic! It\u2019s our last show for the year. Engineer X, Engineer Am-Rock and I would like to thank you so much for tuning in. We hope we kept things interesting and that you will stay with us as we go fanatically into 2025.</p>\r\n<p>Just my opinion, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a time when music wasn\u2019t essential to getting through the challenges life throws at us, seemingly at every turn. That being said, I think music becomes more of an asset in certain times. It keeps us inspired, curious and encouraged. I have no crystal ball for this kind of thing but it very well could be that we will be leaning on music pretty hard next year. Good thing for us, there\u2019s a lot of good music to be heard and we\u2019re going to listen to a lot of it.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0We hope you\u2019ll find tonight\u2019s show to be a good soundtrack for whatever you\u2019re up to as 2024 draws to a close.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Yesterday, Engineer X and I started putting the finishing touches on our first show for next year. It\u2019s going to be a great one. Until then, keep jamming and STAY FANATIC!!!\u00a0</p>", "campaign_metadata": null, "square_image_retina": "https://www.kcrw.com/music/shows/henry-rollins/kcrw-broadcast-821/@@images/image/giant-square", "show_title": "Henry Rollins", "campaign": null, "Title": "KCRW Broadcast 821", "image": "https://www.kcrw.com/music/shows/henry-rollins/kcrw-broadcast-821/@@images/image", "ending": "2024-12-29T00:00:00-08:00", "event_start": null, "duration": 7259.559, "excerpts": [], "ando_video_id": "", "next": "https://www.kcrw.com/music/shows/metropolis/metropolis-playlist-december-28-2024/player.json", "square_image_url": "https://www.kcrw.com/music/shows/henry-rollins/kcrw-broadcast-821/@@images/image/listing-square", "songlist": "https://tracklist-api.kcrw.com/Simulcast/date/2025/12/28?time=22:00&on_demand=1", "uuid": "a1d6d70c9b7d46b8bc3b44d524e53f48", "show_uuid": "a73ec36f655c9452cf88f50e99cba946", "title": "KCRW Broadcast 821", "headline": "KCRW Broadcast 821", "media": [{"embed_url": "https://www.kcrw.com/music/shows/henry-rollins/kcrw-broadcast-821/streamguys-audio/embed", "rtmp_url": null, "expires": null, "low_bitrate_url": "https://ondemand-media.kcrw.com/fdd/audio/download/kcrw/music/hr/KCRW-henry_rollins-kcrw_broadcast_821-251228.mp3?awCollectionId=henry-rollins&aw_0_1st.ri=kcrw&awEpisodeId=kcrw-broadcast-821", "dash_url": null, "duration": 7259.559, "mimetype": "MP3", "end": 7259.559, "effective": null, "url": "https://ondemand-media.kcrw.com/fdd/audio/download/kcrw/music/hr/KCRW-henry_rollins-kcrw_broadcast_821-251228.mp3?awCollectionId=henry-rollins&aw_0_1st.ri=kcrw&awEpisodeId=kcrw-broadcast-821", "hosting": "streamguys", "start": 0, "rtmp_server": null, "hls_url": null, "type": "audio"}], "segments": [], "image_retina": "https://www.kcrw.com/music/shows/henry-rollins/kcrw-broadcast-821/@@images/image/page-header", "program_code": "hr", "links": [], "download_url": null, "id": "a1d6d70c9b7d46b8bc3b44d524e53f48", "airdate": "2024-12-28T22:00:00-08:00", "live": false, "square_image": "https://www.kcrw.com/music/shows/henry-rollins/kcrw-broadcast-821/@@images/image/listing-square", "scrubbing_restrictions": "no-restrictions", "hosts": [{"uuid": "5883da63a527de85856a5c05e27331b8", "title": "Host of 'Henry Rollins'", "url": "https://www.kcrw.com/people/henry-rollins", "twitter": "henryrollins", "description": "In describing Henry Rollins, the tendency is to try to squeeze as many labels as possible into a single sentence.", "image_url": "https://www.kcrw.com/people/henry-rollins/@@images/rectangular_image", "name": "Henry Rollins"}], "itunes_url": null, "channel": "kcrwlive", "next_date": "2024-12-28T20:00:00-08:00", "description": "Fanatic!
